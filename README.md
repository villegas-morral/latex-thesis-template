# LaTeX Thesis Template

A user-friendly and organised LaTeX template for a final thesis. The code for my thesis, created using this template, is available [here](https://github.com/villegas-morral/masters-thesis/tree/main/report).


## Features

- **Commented code:** thoroughly documented to ensure it is accessible to users with minimal experience.
- **Modular design:** separates text, figures, and preamble for better organisation.
- **PDF output options:**
  - Digital: no extra blank pages and equal margins.
  - Printed: symmetric margins with extra blank pages to ensure sections start on the right hand side.
